ABC 440 
A - super easy, just need to multiply the number by the power of 2 given
B - also pretty easy, just need to sort the list in ascending order and give the first 3 positions

C - 
-> did a bruteforce approach first
-> correctly identified that x must only go uptil 2w or so and after that the pattern will start repeating
-> could not make the observation that we will actually need find the sum of consecutive w numbers always
-> my bruteforce approach would TLE
learning :
-> learned a new technique how to group indexes based on their modulus with a specific number
-> learned how to do sliding bucket on these group type questions
-> always check the constraints, the bruteforce approach is o(W*N), whereas with this grouping approach it can be done in O(w+N);

D - 
-> very good and tricky problem
-> started making it too complex during the contest
-> couldn't figure out how I should efficiently reach the Yth integer without making a whole list of numbers that aren't in the list
-> simulating the problem or even using maths tricks such as incrementing in chunks won't work
learning:
-> for extremely punishing test cases we'll use binary search on the answer, for these kind of problems
-> complexity O((N+QlogY)logN)

E-
-> didn't get time to solve during contest
learning: 
-> this is a very good problem with a peculiar and a really difficult idea to understand
-> the naive or brute force approach is to find all the possible combinations and then sort them decreasing
-> but this approach quickly TLEs/MLEs
-> use a max heap, to do best first search on the state of the array
-> a good observation you have to make is that in a sorted(descending) array, the next best solution
is found by only increasing the the adjacent type of cookies
-> do this question again deeply

F-
-> did not get time to solve during contest
