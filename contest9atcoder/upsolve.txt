pretty bad performance as compared to what I wanted

A:
- super easy question
- just had to check if all the digits of the number are equal to each other

B: 
- also super easy
- just sum the digits
- O(N) solution

C:
- this question seems easy and also figured out all the important stuff during the contest
- a small observation that i>j must also be true costed me a lot of time
learning:
- deeply think through your solution
- the thing that was going wrong is in the while loop just checking (i<j) and automatically assuming that all the pairs are being made
- but on looking closely found out that in the case that i==j it'll make a pair with itself and in that case gives wrong answer
- so while making loops think deeply about the edge cases

D:
-> nice question
learning:
-> see the constraints carefully

E:
- really good problem
learning:
- In a set while finding the position, it's nice to add an extremely big number and an extremely small number
- This allows you to find the lower bound easily without caring about edge cases
- also lower bound(x) is: smallest element greater than or equal to x
- upper bound(x) is: smallest element strictly greater than x
- also learnt how to solve variable sliding window problem without making it tooo complex

F:
- currently the problem is out of my scope
- too hard to comprehend, will revisit later
- but the basic idea in this problem is to do a binary search on answer
