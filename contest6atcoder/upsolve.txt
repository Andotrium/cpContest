contest ABC441 (https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc441)

A-> pretty easy just have to check for X and Y to be in range (P->100+P) and (Q->100+Q) respectively
B-> also quite easy, count the number of occurrences in both langs and apply appropriate conditions

C:
-> This was a decent question
-> the thing is we have to think of the worst case
-> The worst case is when you chose N-K cups already and none of them contained sake
-> to do this the sake has to be in the remiaing K cups
-> and the worst case for this is when the sake is in the smallest K cups (because that'll make you choose more cups for completing X ml)
-> now from the smallest k cups we'll start by choosing in the descending order of volume
-> so simply : sort in descending, then after n-k cups start adding the volume and break when it's greater than X

D:
-> A simple graphs question
-> do a bfs on the nodes and just keep track of length and contest
-> kill the nodes with length greater than L
learning:
-> don't be scared of seeing new topics, think from first principles and try solving it

E:
-> couldn't solve during the contest
-> took too long on question D
learning:
